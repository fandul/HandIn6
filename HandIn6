1. Explain the concept of Hybrid Mobile App Development

   Hybrid app are like most of the native apps that is installed on your mobile device, except that they are made with
   combination of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for example native Android apps are built in Java).
   The main difference is that they are hosted inside a native application that utilizes a mobile platforms WebView.
   This allows hybrid apps to access device sensors like accelerometer, camera etc.

2. Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid Mobile App Development
   compared to Native App Development.

   Pros: 1. Developers can reuse their existing skills in web-development.
         2. Can be installed from app stores as native apps.
         3. removing browser from user experience.
         4. HTML allows to add features like animations and etc.
   Cons: 1. early hybrid app where slower in performance compared to native app.
         2. not all native features are available for hybrid apps.
         3. may not provide true native experience considering the user interaction.

3. Explain about the "building blocks" involved in an ionic Hybrid Application

4. Explain and demonstrate ways to debug Hybrid Mobile Applications Running on a real device

5. Explain when and why CORS is a problem for Hybrid Mobile Applications

6. Explain how and why it is possible for a Hybrid Application to access native phone devices like location,
   calendar etc.

7. Explain using an example the "fundamentals" of an ionic application.

8. Explain using an example how your Hybrid Application communicates with a backend and how CORS
   problems were solved (if any)
