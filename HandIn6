1. Explain the concept of Hybrid Mobile App Development

   Hybrid app are like most of the native apps that is installed on your mobile device, except that they are made with
   combination of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for example native Android apps are built in Java).
   The main difference is that they are hosted inside a native application that utilizes a mobile platforms WebView.
   This allows hybrid apps to access device sensors like accelerometer, camera etc.

2. Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid Mobile App Development
   compared to Native App Development.

   Pros: 1. Developers can reuse their existing skills in web-development.
         2. Can be installed from app stores as native apps.
         3. removing browser from user experience.
         4. HTML allows to add features like animations and etc.
   Cons: 1. early hybrid app where slower in performance compared to native app.
         2. not all native features are available for hybrid apps.
         3. may not provide true native experience considering the user interaction.

3. Explain about the "building blocks" involved in an ionic Hybrid Application.

    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the "building blocks" of ionic Hybrid applications.

4. Explain and demonstrate ways to debug Hybrid Mobile Applications Running on a real device.

   You can debug hybrid apps in computers browser on simulators or emulators, although they can be quite slow to start.
   Testing is possible also on mobile browser.
   testing as a native app, if you are developing on Android device just plug your phon and run it.

5. Explain when and why CORS is a problem for Hybrid Mobile Applications.

   CORS is problem while we develop app locally and we need to access data from some API. Problem occurs when we using
   ionic serve and we test our hybrid app in our browser.
   This happens due to the browserâ€™s security policies, which essentially a way to block access to data
   from other domains. This applies to XMLHttpRequests (XHR) requests, which are also known as AJAX requests made with
   JavaScript to load data. When using Ionic and Angular, any requests made to another domain fall into this category
   and are subject to this security policy.

6. Explain how and why it is possible for a Hybrid Application to access native phone devices like location,
   calendar etc.

   Hybrid apps can access phone devices with utilizing a mobile platforms WebView hosted inside a native container.

7. Explain using an example the "fundamentals" of an ionic application.

   Ionic fundamentals is in HTML, specific ionic directives are used as in this example:

    <ion-side-menu-content>
    	<ion-header-bar class="bar-dark">
            <h1 class="title">Todo</h1>
        <!-- New Task button-->
        <button class="button button-icon" ng-click="newTask()">
          <i class="icon ion-compose"></i>
        </button>
          </ion-header-bar>
          <ion-content>
    	  <!-- our list and list items-->
    	  <ion-list>
    	  <ion-item ng-repeat="task in tasks">
    	  {{task.title}}
    	  </ion-item>
    	  </ion-list>
          </ion-content>
        </ion-side-menu-content>
        
8. Explain using an example how your Hybrid Application communicates with a backend and how CORS
   problems were solved (if any)
